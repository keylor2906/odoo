"Aside from manually managing access using custom code, Odoo provides two "
"main data-driven mechanisms to manage or restrict access to data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:12
msgid ""
"Both mechanisms are linked to specific users through *groups*: a user "
"belongs to any number of groups, and security mechanisms are associated "
"to groups, thus applying security mechamisms to users."

"Each access control has a model to which it grants permissions, the "
"permissions it grants and optionally a group."

#: ../../reference/security.rst:26
msgid ""
"Access controls are additive, for a given model a user has access all "
"permissions granted to any of its groups: if the user belongs to one "
"group which allows writing and another which allows deleting, they can "
"both write and delete."

#: ../../reference/security.rst:31
msgid ""
"If no group is specified, the access control applies to all users, "
"otherwise it only applies to the members of the given group."

"Available permissions are creation (``perm_create``), searching and "
"reading (``perm_read``), updating existing records (``perm_write``) and "
"deleting existing records (``perm_unlink``)"

msgid "Record Rules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:43

"Record rules are conditions that records must satisfy for an operation "
"(create, read, update or delete) to be allowed. It is applied record-by-"

"Global rules and group rules (rules restricted to specific groups versus "

msgid ""
"Global rules are subtractive, they *must all* be matched for a record to "
"be accessible"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:64
msgid ""
"Group rules are additive, if *any* of them matches (and all global rules "
"match) then the record is accessible"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:67
msgid ""
"This means the first *group rule* restricts access, but any further "
"*group rule* expands it, while *global rules* can only ever restrict "
"access (or have no effect)."
