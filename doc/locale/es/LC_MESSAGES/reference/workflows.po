"When an activity has been completed, its outgoing transitions are "

"condition is defined (i.e., no signal or trigger is defined), the "
"condition is evaluated by Odoo, and if it evaluates to ``True``, the "
"worklfow instance progresses through the transition.  If the condition is"
" not met, it will be reevaluated every time the associated record is "
"modified, or by an explicit method call to do it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/workflows.rst:278
msgid ""
"By default, the attribute ``condition`` (i.e., the expression to be "
"evaluated) is just \"True\", which trivially evaluates to ``True``. Note "
"that the condition may be several lines long; in that case, the value of "

"In addition to a condition, a transition can specify a signal name. When "

"waiting to be woken up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/workflows.rst:299
msgid ""
"In order to wake up a transition with a defined signal name, the signal "
"must be sent to the workflow instance. A common way to send a signal is "

"With conditions that evaluate to ``False``, transitions are not taken "

"condition is not satisfied, triggers are recorded in database. Later, it "
"is possible to wake up specifically the workflow instances that installed"
" those triggers, offering them to reevaluate their transition conditions."
